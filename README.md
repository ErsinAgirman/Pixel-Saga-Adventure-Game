Some Bugs fixed. 
let me tell you some bugs i fixed ;

Moving Platform Bug:
We could stick to the moving platform, so I created a material called Friction Zero to prevent this from happening.
"FrictionZero" it is a Material, there is two values, Friction and Bounciness, I set them both equal to zero.

Button Bugs fixed:
Mechanical fluidity of the buttons is provided
