# Pixel-Saga-Adventure-Game
I am making a new game on Unity. It's my practise project. I'm improving my skill with this game project.


I will add my progress here.

Day2
I wrote breakable ground code so a new element has been added to the traps section.

Day3
I wrote vanishing and regenerating trap code for my game today, I used the Toggle function.
